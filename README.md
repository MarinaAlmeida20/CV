## Marina Almeida

A highly driven and ambitious junior web developer. CodeYourFuture prides itself on developing juniors of all backgrounds into ambitious developers with a keen focus on craftsmanship and best practices at its core. Here I was able to learn and hone my technical and soft skills through communicative problem solving, test driven development and group projects that will help me to integrate seamlessly into any team. Since graduating I have begun working on personal coding projects and studying towards becoming better in software development.
